King and Ace Cricket is a card game invented by Vyktory Knight.


## Rules

This is a two-player game with a standard 52 card deck where two players compete against each other in a simulated cricket match.

A coin flip decides who bats or bowls first and play begins by drawing six cards. The aim is to play a card that's higher than your opponents.

If the bowler's card is higher,  a dot ball or a wicket happens. If the batter's card is higher, the batter scores that many runs or causes a wicket. Otherwise if tied, there is an automatic dot ball.

The innings ends after ten overs or five wickets then the players change sides. Standard cricket scoring rules decide who wins. A standard cricket scoresheet can be used to score the game.

The card values are Ace to 4 scoring one run, 5 to 7 scoring two runs, 8 scoring three, 9 to 10 scoring a four, Jack and Queen scoring a six and King being a wicket.
